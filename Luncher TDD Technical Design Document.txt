Proposal
________________
- What problem does your app solve?
  School-kids hunger.  Help schools with lunch fund needs.  Organized donation system.


- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
   Allow schools to sign up and let donors know they are in need of funding and how much they need.  Allows donors’ to donate easily to schools with lunch funding needs.


- What is the mission statement?
No child left hungry, no child left behind.  Our vision is to end hunger.  Luncher is a small step in helping end hunger at school.  Luncher is an organized donation system that allows for a school to broadcast the lunch fund needs of their students.  Schools declare an amount of the donation that they would like to be fulfilled in order to provide lunches for those that go without.  Donors are able to select schools that they would like to donate to.

Frameworks - Libraries
________________
- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
1. UX = UX Power Tools, SketchApp Sources libraries
2. UI = 
3. FE = 
4. BE =


- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?


- Are you required to pay to use the API?


- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)












For Data Scientists
________________
- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app


Target Audience
________________
- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
1. School Administrators whose school need help funding students’ lunches.
2. Donors who would like to donate money to help schools to provide lunches for those that go without lunch.


- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
      UX - Protopersona - based on secondary research and the team’s educated guess of who
       they should be designing for.   Do Competitive Analysis and research competitors’ user 
       pain points or available public information on competitor’s product. .


- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
      UX - Will be doing usability testing - ask users to complete specific tasks.
      User interviews




Research
________________
- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.


Prototype Key Feature(s)
________________
- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
